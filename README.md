IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

This project demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using an LSTM network. It covers data preprocessing, including text cleaning and tokenization, followed by sequence padding to prepare inputs for the model. An LSTM-based architecture is built using TensorFlow/Keras to capture long-term dependencies in the review text, effectively classifying reviews as positive or negative. Detailed evaluations and visualizations of model performance underscore its potential for natural language processing applications. This project showcases the practical implementation of deep learning for sentiment analysis and serves as a foundation for advanced NLP tasks.
